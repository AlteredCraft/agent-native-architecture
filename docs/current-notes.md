# Notes

This is an ephemeral list of considerations i'd like to review later.

- [x] DONE: Review the management of memory → See `docs/global-context.md`
    - Introduced **Global Context** as first-class concept: always-injected, agent-evolved knowledge that shapes reasoning
    - Deferred Entity Context (entity-scoped reference knowledge) for future consideration
    - Original memory CRUD questions (update/delete) subsumed by GC line-addressable tools 

- [ ] Context is the critical resource for agents. We might consider leveraging sub-agents to handle common tasks, only returning the result to the main agent. This would help manage context window limitations.

- [ ] In this post, Link to previous post , this also spoke to less code, more llm agency
